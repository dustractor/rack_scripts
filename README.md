# rack_scripts
 a few vcv rack related scripts

was pleasantly surprised to find that presets for vcv rack modules are json text files so they can be generated programmatically

using a file-browser to repeatedly browse to the sample library folder and load individually each file and then save as a preset would take forever

so i made these scripts

they are very much rough drafts but they "work for me"
